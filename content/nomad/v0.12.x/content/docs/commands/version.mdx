# Command: version

The `version` command displays build information about the running binary,
including the release version and the exact revision.

## Usage

```plaintext
nomad version
```

## Output

This command prints both the version number as well as the exact commit SHA used
during the build. The SHA may also have the string `+CHANGES` appended to the
end, indicating that local, uncommitted changes were detected at build time.

## Examples

```shell-session
$ nomad version
Nomad v0.0.0-615-gcf3c6aa-dev (cf3c6aa8a75a689987b689d75ae2ba73458465cb+CHANGES)
```
