# Operator HTTP API

The `/operator` endpoints provide cluster-level tools for Nomad operators, such
as interacting with the Raft subsystem, licensing, snapshots, autopilot and scheduler configuration.

~> Use this interface with extreme caution, as improper use could lead to a
Nomad outage and even loss of data.

See the [Outage Recovery](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/nomad/outage-recovery) guide for some examples of how
these capabilities are used. For a CLI to perform these operations manually,
please see the documentation for the
[`nomad operator`](/docs/commands/operator) command.
