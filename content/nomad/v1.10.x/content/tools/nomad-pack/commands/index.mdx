# Nomad Pack command-line interface (CLI) reference

The Nomad Pack CLI is a well-behaved command-line application. In erroneous
cases, the CLI returns a non-zero exit status. To view a list of available
commands, run the `nomad-pack` command with no arguments, `-h`, or `--help`. To
access help for any specific subcommand, run the subcommand with the `-h`
argument.
