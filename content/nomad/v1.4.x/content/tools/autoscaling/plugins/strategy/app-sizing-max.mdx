# Dynamic Application Sizing Max Strategy Plugin

<EnterpriseAlert>
  This functionality only exists in Nomad Autoscaler Enterprise. This is not
  present in the open source version of Nomad Autoscaler.
</EnterpriseAlert>

The `app-sizing-max` plugin calculates the maximum value seen for the target
resource within the available dataset. This plugin is ideally suited for memory
resources since workloads don’t release their memory too often and
underprovisioning could cause OOM errors.

## Agent Configuration Options

The `app-sizing-max` plugin is automatically launched by Nomad Autoscaler
Enterprise and so the following setup is optional.

```hcl
strategy "app-sizing-max" {
  driver = "app-sizing-max"
}
```

## Policy Configuration Options

```hcl
check "max" {
  strategy "app-sizing-max" {}
}
```

The `app-sizing-max` plugin doesn't have any configuration.
